			<h3>
				Your blog lacks your “why”
			</h3>
			<p>How much energy are you expending on your blog? I don’t just mean writing, designing, optimizing SEO, or using social media.

				I mean how much of yourself are you putting into your blog?

				The power of your self, injected in your blog, can take you far. It’s about bringing forth your beliefs to the world and sharing your vision with people.

				And it all fuses together to create your “why”.
